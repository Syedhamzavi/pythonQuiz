This Python project is a console-based quiz game centered around data structures. Leveraging the Colorama library for vibrant console output, the program guides users through a series of questions, each with multiple-choice options. Users input their answers, and the system promptly provides feedback, indicating correct and incorrect responses with colored text.

The project revolves around a `Quiz` class, encapsulating the quiz functionality. The class holds a list of questions, each represented by a dictionary containing the question itself, options, and the correct option's index. The user's score is tracked throughout the quiz.

The `Quiz` class features methods to display questions, obtain user answers, and check correctness. The `run_quiz` method orchestrates the quiz, shuffling questions and presenting them one by one. The final score, along with the time taken to complete the quiz, is displayed in a colorful summary.

The quiz questions cover essential data structure topics, including linked lists, principles of stacks and queues, differences between these structures, suitability for recursive algorithms, time complexity in binary search trees, and collision resolution in hash tables.

In the main block, a list of data structure-related questions is defined, and a `Quiz` object is created with these questions. The `run_quiz` method is then invoked to execute the quiz.

This project serves as an interactive and educational tool for testing and enhancing knowledge of fundamental data structure concepts. Its modular design allows for easy customization by adding more questions or incorporating additional features, making it an adaptable and engaging learning resource.
